# Outlook Calendar to Jira

This project provides a SwiftUI-based macOS application that reads Outlook meetings and logs work to Jira. The code is a minimal skeleton showing the overall structure.

## Building

Use Swift Package Manager with macOS 13 or later. Some components rely on frameworks unavailable on Linux, so builds must run on macOS.
